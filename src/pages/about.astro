I am a final year student at the University of Exeter pursuing a BSc in Computer Science achieving an average of 80% after my
penultimate year.
<br/><br/>
Other than my passion for programming and technology, I spend my other free time on Cycling; Reading and Research; and slowly trying to learn Mandarin; as well as many other things !
<br/><br/>
All of my hobbies have foundations in my liking of intracate details. In Cycling I can focus on data whilst I am training trying to stay within the correct zones and analysing the
data post training. I spend a lot of time researching the frontiers of theoretical Computer Science, with an area I am really interested in at the moment being applying machine learning to solve problems that 
are infeasible using exhaustive methods, hence my dissertation being on applying machine learning to compiler optimisations !
<br/><br/>
I also like getting out of the city and exploring new places either by cycling, or getting the bus or train. The photo at the top of the page shows me (left) showing one of my friends Wistman's Wood in Dartmoor!
