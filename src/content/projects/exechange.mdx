### My Role
During the first phases of development my role was to be a leader in designing and implementing our teams CI/CD pipelines, this
included researching and implementing GitHub actions and also educating the rest of the team on industry standard Git flows to ensure
that when pushing to our live product nothing could go (massively) wrong.

Then once development was in full swing, my job was to implement a user authorisation and authentication system. This included allowing 
a user to register and log in. The registration process involved ensuring that a user was a student at the University so I implemented an 
email verification system using one-time codes.

I was also a key member that implemented and ran tests during development of the whole product. This was to ensure that every team member's work
ran together and to catch any errors early before they may have propogated and become much more difficult to fix.

This was developed for the group software engineering module at my University where we had to design, develop and implement a product that helped
introduce more sustainability at the University. We chose to try and tackle the area of fast fashion, where it is particularly prevelant at University where
societies are consistently requiring fancy dress at their socials. The module leaders really liked our project where we achieved a grade of 75%.
