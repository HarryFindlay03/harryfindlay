### Lowdown
Was a key member of the development team that designed and created a clothes trading marketplace exclusive to students at the University of Exeter.

### Key Technologies
- Python
- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- React
- PostgresSQL
- Git
- Docker

### My Role
During the first phases of development my role was to be a leader in designing and implementing our teams CI/CD pipelines, this
included researching and implementing GitHub actions and also educating the rest of the team on industry standard Git flows to ensure
that when pushing to our live product nothing could go (massively) wrong.

Then once development was in full swing, my job was to implement a user authorisation and authentication system. This included allowing 
a user to register and log in. The registration process involved ensuring that a user was a student at the University so I implemented an 
email verification system using one-time codes.

I was also a key member that implemented and ran tests during development of the whole product. This was to ensure that everyones work happily
ran together and to catch any errors early before they may have propogated and become much more difficult to fix.
