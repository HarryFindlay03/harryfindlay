### Lowdown
Developed two Haskell and two Prolog programs to complete tasks set out in a University assignment.

### Key Technologies
- Haskell
- Prolog

<br/>

### More Information
Each of the programs were designed to answer a question that was given as past Sunday Times Teasers. The first two programs were written in Haskell
and purely functional. This was the first time that I have ever used a purely functional language, and I think this was my favourite experience ever in programming, and
now in all of my programming I try my best to apply bits of the pure functional paradigm wherever I can !

The other two programs were written in Prolog, which is a logic language. This was really interesting and again really enjoyable, where you program using facts and clauses and computation
is done by proof of those facts and clauses. Once I had figured out what was going on, I found Prolog really elegant and was able to develop the programs to solve a Suko and solve another 
Sunday Times Teaser as required in my assignment.

All the hardwork learning how Haskell and Prolog worked payed off and I achieved 100% in this assignment !
